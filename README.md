# Council-Decision.py

A draft for a secure and anonymous voting-backend, which uses proven encryption algorithms. It is designed to allow transmission of cast votes over different transports like XMPP or E-Mail. Additional transports can be added by external packages.

The frontend, [Council](https://github.com/jkrenzer/council.py), is developed in it's own repository.
